The company operates several thermal power stations, including Neyveli Thermal Power Station-I, Neyveli Thermal Power Station-II, and the Neyveli New Thermal Power Station. The Neyveli New Thermal Power Station, with a capacity of 1,000 MW, commenced operations in 2019 and 2021, replacing the older 600 MW Neyveli Thermal Power Station-I, which was decommissioned in 2020 after 52 years of service. </h4>
        <br>
        <h4>* In its pursuit of expanding thermal power capacity, NLCIL has embarked on projects like the Ghatampur Thermal Power Plant in Uttar Pradesh, which will add 1,980 MW (3x660 MW) upon completion. The first unit of this plant began commercial operations in December 2024. Additionally, the company is developing the Talabira Thermal Power Project in Odisha, aiming for a capacity of 3,200 MW (4x800 MW), with land acquisition and contract awards underway.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>* Looking ahead, NLCIL has outlined plans to enhance its power generation capacity to 17,171 MW by 2030, comprising 11,140 MW from thermal sources and 6,031 MW from renewable energy. This strategic move includes significant investments in renewable energy, with ₹50,000 crore allocated for expansion in this sector, reflecting the company's commitment to sustainability. Notably, NLCIL does not foresee any new thermal capacity additions post-2030, aligning with global trends towards cleaner energy sources. </h4>

        <h3>The lignite seam was first exposed in August 1961 and regular mining of lignite commenced in May 1962. German excavation technology in open cast mining, using Bucket Wheel Excavators, Conveyors and Spreaders were used for the first time in the country in Neyveli Mine-I. The capacity of this mine was 6.5 MT which met the fuel requirement of TS-I. The capacity was increased to 10.5MT of lignite per annum from March 2003 under Mine-I expansion scheme and at present meets the fuel requirement for generating power from TPS-I and TPS-I Expansion.</h3>
